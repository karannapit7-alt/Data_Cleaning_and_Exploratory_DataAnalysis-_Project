# Key Objectives
1. Handle missing values and duplicate records
2. Clean and standardize raw datasets
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Generate insights using statistical analysis and visualizations

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Pandas – data manipulation and cleaning
3. NumPy – numerical operations
4. Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
5. Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis

# Key Tasks Performed
1. Identified and handled missing values
2. Removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity
3. Cleaned and formatted column names
4. Performed descriptive statistical analysis
5. Visualized data distributions and relationships
